<h1>Lab - Finding Anagrams</h1>

<p> In this writeup it is shown how the UNIX philosophy of combining simple
programs using pipes can solve an interesting problem.  The problem is to
find all anagrams in a file containing words.  The UNIX tools that will be
used are:  (1) a small C program that uses library calls to do string
operations and sorting, (2) the UNIX <tt>sort</tt> command, (3) a small AWK
program (maybe 2), and finally the UNIX <tt>head</tt> or <tt>tail</tt>
command. </p>

<p>  The directory for this lab is
<code>tux:/home/kschmidt/public_html/CS265/Labs/Anagram</code>  </p>

<p>  Your job is to write a single script to pull all of this together.
Most of the machinery mentioned above is given to you, in this directory, or
right here in the sheet.  </p>

<h2>Problem Statement and Solution</h2>

<p> Two words are anagrams if one can be obtained from the other by permuting
the letters.  For example, the words stop and pots are anagrams since the
letters "s", "t", "o", and "p" in stop can be rearranged to obtain the word
pots. </p>

<p> A naive way to test if two words are anagrams is to produce all permutations
of the letters of one of the words and compare each possible permuted
sequence of letters to the other word.  If any sequence is equal to the other
word then they are anagrams.  For example, to determine if "ant" and "tan"
are anagrams, we first generate the six possible permutations of the letters
in ant: </p>

<blockquote><pre>ant
atn
nat
nta
tan
tna</pre></blockquote>

<p> and compare each to tan.  Since the 5th permuted sequence is equal to tan,
ant and tan are anagrams. </p>

<p> The problem with this approach is that as the number of letters increases,
the number of permuted sequences gets very big.  For example, there are
3,628,800 permutations of a 10 letter word. </p>

<p> A better approach to test if two words are anagrams is to sort the letters
in each word and then compare the sorted words.  If the words are anagrams
then they must have the same letters and if they have the same letters
then they are anagrams.  Therefore this test determines if two words are
anagrams with one comparison.  For example, if we sort the letters in 
stop and pots, we obtain the letter sequence opts for both words, which shows
that they are anagrams. </p>

<p> Given a file containing a list words we want to find all of the anagrams.
We will do this by dividing the words into anagram classes.  An anagram
class containing a particular word is the collection of words in the
input list that are anagrams of the given word.  Note that if two words
are anagrams to a given word then they are anagrams to each other.  Thus
any two words in an anagram class are anagrams.  Moreover, all of the
words in the input file that are anagrams to any of the words in the anagram
class are contained in the anagram class. </p>

<p> A naive way to find all of the anagram classes is for each word to
search through all of the other words and check each to see if it
is an anagram.  This approach is very time consuming.  A better approach
would be to: </p>

<ol>
<li>For each word in the file sort the letters to produce a key.</li>
<li>Sort all of the words in the input file by their key.</li>
<li>In the sorted list find all adjacent words with the same key (these
	are the anagram classes).</li>
</ol>

<p> This will be implemented in UNIX in the following steps: </p>

<li>Use a C program called <tt><b>sign</b></tt> to read the input file (the
dictionary on our machines, /usr/share/dict/words) and to produce an output
file where each line contains the key (the letters of the word sorted)
followed by the word.  This program will read from standard input and write
to standard output so that we do not have to specify the input file in the
program and we can use the output in a pipe.  The name of the the executable
program will be <tt><b>sign</b></tt> .  To create this: </li>

<blockquote><tt>gcc -osign sign.c</tt></blockquote>

<li>The temporary file containing words and keys produced in (1) will be
sorted using the UNIX <tt>sort</tt> command.</li>

<li>Use an AWK program to collect all adjacent words with the same key.
The result will be a file containing an anagram class per line.  The
file containing the awk program is <a
	href='./squash.awk'><tt>squash.awk</tt></a> .</li>

<p> Here is the UNIX command to do this.  The file /usr/share/dict/words
contains a list of just under 100,000 words.  To verify this use the command
<tt>wc</tt>. </p>

<blockquote><tt>
	% ./sign &lt; /usr/share/dict/words | sort | awk -f squash.awk &gt; out
</tt></blockquote>

<p> The output will be in the file <tt>out</tt>.  The awk command can be put
into a file called <tt>squash</tt>.  Such a file containing UNIX commands is
called a shell script and is itself interpred as a command as soon as the
execute permission has been set.  The resulting UNIX pipe, which uses the
shell script squash instead of the call to awk, becomes </p>

<blockquote><tt>
	% ./sign &lt; /usr/share/dict/words | sort | ./squash &gt; out
</tt></blockquote>

<p> To find the largest anagram classes, we can first count the number of words 
in each class (I'm thinkin' another AWK script here) and then sort the file
by these counts.  Here is a UNIX command to do this: </p>

<blockquote><tt>
	% awk '{ print NF " " $0}' &lt; out | sort -n | tail
</tt></blockquote>

<p> In this command the AWK program is given between the single quotes.  The
utility <code>tail</code> prints the last 10 lines of a file.  Here is some
sample output (from an old dictionary): </p>

<blockquote><pre><tt>
4 glare lager large regal
4 lament mantel mantle mental
4 lascar rascal sacral scalar
4 leap pale peal plea
4 leapt petal plate pleat
4 least slate stale steal
4 mate meat tame team
4 pare pear rape reap
4 resin rinse risen siren
5 caret carte cater crate trace
</tt></pre></blockquote>


<p> Students should try these commands to see if they can produce the same
output.  Note that you can view the output of any intermediate stage
by piping the results through <tt>more</tt>.  For example: </p>

<blockquote><tt>
	%  sign &lt; /usr/share/dict/words | more
</tt></blockquote>

<p> You can quit more by typing "q" ("man more" for more info on more). </p>

<h2> Submission </h2>

<p> Submit all the files needed for this lab (and <u>only</u> those
needed). </p>

<p> Your top-level script will put this all together; it'll check for the
needed files, compile the C program (and anything else you need to have
done), and put it all together, to print (to the screen) the 10 largest
anagram classes. </p>

<ul>
	<li> <tt><b>anagram</b></tt> - Your top-level Bash script, the one we run
		to get the output.</li>
	<li> Any other files required, directly or indirectly, by your script
		(except for the dictionary itself). </li>
	<li> <tt><b>README</b></tt> <i>(optional)</i> - anything you want to tell
		us before we grade. </li>
</ul>
