CS265 Lab 8 Interfaces, MakeFiles

1. Interfaces
Q1.1 
i)Interface should hide implementation detail, they can be changed without
affecting clients.

ii)Use non-overlapping functions and cpabilities. So it will have minimum
set of behaviors that larger interfaces are harder to master and maintain.

iii) It will minimise side effects, document any side effects, decrease
coupling and explicitly define what external services are needed.

iv) Use consistent naming schemes, define arguments consistently and behave
similarly to associated interfaces

Q1.2
It doesn't handle input lines more than 199 and records more than 20 fields.
Comma inside quotes would not handle properly. Leading quote are not
removed. It would not reset the variables. Empty fields would not be handle
correctly

Q1.3
Reset function sets variables bakc to starting values.
It will get no limit number of lines and fields. 
It will accetp different end of line symbles.
The comma in quotes are handling properly.
The leading quoter is fixed.

Q1.4
Empty filed would not be handled correctly. No, it could only solve one file at a time. Because only one instance of the
required variables exist.

Q1.5
It allowed to have 2 file solved at same time. Empty fields still would not
be handle correctly. 

Q1.6
Yes, since it has hide implementation details from user. And a small
orthogonal set primitives, it dont reach behind the users back, and it do
the same thing the same way everywhere.
